To truly unleash its potential and immerse yourself in movies, music, and gaming, you can take a few simple yet effective steps. Here’s how to maximize your Bose soundbar's performance.</p>

    <li><strong>Avoid Obstacles:</strong> Ensure there are no obstructions between the speakers and your listening area. Furniture or tall objects can interfere with sound dispersion.</li>
</ul>
