However, the LG OLED C2 takes the lead with its ultra-thin profile, making it easier to mount on a wall while still offering robust performance.</p>

<h3>Picture Quality</h3>
<p>Picture quality is where the Sony XR55A95L truly excels. Equipped with the latest XR OLED Contrast Pro technology, this TV delivers deep blacks and vibrant colors, making HDR content shine. Here’s how it compares with leading competitors:</p>
