Gamers often debate the merits of OLED versus LED, and here, we’ll explore why the Sony XR55A95L BRAVIA XR A95L stands out as the ultimate choice for gaming enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The Sony XR55A95L utilizes OLED technology, which is known for its striking image quality. Each pixel in an OLED display emits its own light, allowing for true blacks and vibrant colors.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Black Levels:</strong> OLED TVs like the Sony XR55A95L achieve perfect black levels by turning off individual pixels. This results in a higher contrast ratio compared to LED TVs, which can struggle with bloom and halo effects around bright objects.</li>
